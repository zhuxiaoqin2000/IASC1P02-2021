    <p><span class = "text_color">Have you ever looked at a beautiful little mews house in London and
       thought "it must be so amazing to live there?"</span> If so, you're not the
        only one. But for the people who actually do live in those homes,
        social media photography has changed what it means to live in a
        picturesque place.Alice Johnston is a longtime resident of Notting Hill,
         the London neighborhood famous for pastel-painted row houses and for
          being the setting of the Julia Roberts/Hugh Grant movie of the same name.

      In that story, everybody had a good time.
    But there can be a darker side to living inside what some people think is a movie set.
    <span class="text_size">"I was once woken up at 6 a.m. on Easter Sunday by French teenagers taking pictures
    outside," </span>Johnston says.She shares another anecdote: "One time I was changing after I
    got out of the shower and there was this elderly man taking a picture (of my windows) with an iPad."
    Although the shutters were closed at the time, she was understandably rattled by the experience.

      <span class="text_font">The Mrs. Clinton Walker House in Carmel-by-the-Sea was completed in 1951 and passed into
      the hands of Henderson and some of his relatives when Walker died. No one lives in it full
      time, but the different family members and their guests take turns staying there. </span>
     Wright fans will come from all over the world to try and get glimpses of some of his masterpieces.
    While some, like the famous Fallingwater house in Pennsylvania, are year-round attractions, others
    remain private residences.Many people who own homes featured in architecture textbooks have to add the
     cost of security measures onto other expenses like utilities and homeowners insurance.
     <span class="text_case">"We put these security cameras in after we had some vandalism about six or seven years ago,"
      Henderson says. The vandalism in question wasn't graffiti, though.</span>
